# Steelmesh Changemate

Changemate is a change notification service and framework. Given the primary purpose of reacting to [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) changes, it has been parked in favour of using the more established project, [follow](https://github.com/iriscouch/follow) from the [iriscouch](http://www.iriscouch.com/) team.
